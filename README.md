### Overview of Docker

Docker is an open-source platform designed to simplify the development, deployment, and management of applications in a containerized environment also known as docker containers. Docker containers are a lightweight and portable way to package and run applications that enable developers to package their applications with all the required dependencies and configurations in a single package that can be easily moved between any environment. Docker containers are simply the running instance of a docker image.

- easy to use by developer
- easily scalablity
- docker containers are efficient in nature 


### Docker Images

- Images are made up of app binaries, dependencies, and metadata. Don't contain a full OS.
- Images are a combination of multiple layers.
- Each Image has its unique ID (to access )and a tag for a different version.
